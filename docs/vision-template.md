## Introduction

>[The purpose of this document is to collect, analyze, and define high-level needs and features of the &lt;&lt;System
Name&gt;&gt;. It focuses on the capabilities needed by the stakeholders and the target users, and why these needs exist.
The details of how the &lt;&lt;System Name&gt;&gt; fulfills these needs are detailed in the use-case and supplementary
specifications.]
>[The introduction of the Vision document provides an overview of the entire document. It includes the purpose and
references of this Vision document.]

## Positioning

### Problem statement

>[Provide a statement summarizing the problem being solved by this project. The following format may be used:]

>The problem of [describe the problem] affects [the stakeholders affected by the problem] the impact of which is [what is the impact of the problem?] a successful solution would be [list some key benefits of a successful solution]

### Product Position Statement

>[Provide an overall statement summarizing, at the highest level, the unique position the product intends to fill in the marketplace. The following format may be used:]

>For [target customer]Who [statement of the need or opportunity] The (product name) is a [product category] That [statement of key benefit; that is, the compelling reason to buy] Unlike [primary competitive alternative] Our product [statement of primary differentiation] [A product position statement communicates the intent of the application and the importance of the project to all concerned personnel.]

## Stakeholder and user descriptions

>[To effectively provide products and services that meet your stakeholders’ and users&#39; real needs it is necessary to identify and involve all of the stakeholders as part of the project. You must also identify the users of the system and ensure that the stakeholder community adequately represents them. This section provides a profile of the stakeholders and users involved in the project, and the key problems that they perceive to be addressed by the proposed solution. It does not describe their specific requests or requirements as these are captured in a separate stakeholder requests artifact. Instead, it provides the background and justification for why the requirements are needed.]

### Stakeholder Summary

>[There are a number of stakeholders with an interest in the development and not all of them are end users. Present a summary list of these non-user stakeholders. (The users are summarized in section 3.2.)]

| [Name the stakeholder type.] | [Briefly describe the stakeholder.] | [Summarize the stakeholder’s key responsibilities with regard to the system being developed; that is, their interest as a stakeholder. For example, this stakeholder: ensures that the system will be maintainable ensures that there will be a market demand for the product’s features monitors the project’s progress approves funding and so forth]|
|--- | --- |---|

### User Summary

>[Present a summary list of all identified users.

| [Name the user type.] | [Briefly describe what they represent with respect to the system.] | List the user’s key responsibilities with regard to the system being developed; for example: captures details produces reports coordinates work and so on] | [If the user is not directly represented, identify which stakeholder is responsible for representing the user’s interest.] |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

### User Environment

[Detail the working environment of the target user. Here are some suggestions:
Number of people involved in completing the task? Is this changing?
How long is a task cycle? Amount of time spent in each activity? Is this changing?
Any unique environmental constraints: mobile, outdoors, in-flight, and so on?
Which system platforms are in use today? Future platforms?
What other applications are in use? Does your application need to integrate with them?
This is where extracts from the Business Model could be included to outline the task and roles involved, and so on.]

### Summary of Key Stakeholder or User Needs

[List the key problems with existing solutions as perceived by the stakeholder or user. Clarify the following issues
for each problem:
• What are the reasons for this problem?
• How is it solved now?
• What solutions does the stakeholder or user want?]
[It is important to understand the relative importance the stakeholder or user places on solving each problem.
Ranking and cumulative voting techniques indicate problems that must be solved versus issues they would like
addressed.
Fill in the following table—if using Rational RequisitePro to capture the Needs, this could be an extract or report
from that tool.]

### Alternatives and Competition

[Identify alternatives the stakeholder perceives as available. These can include buying a competitor’s product,
building a homegrown solution, or simply maintaining the status quo. List any known competitive choices that exist
or may become available. Include the major strengths and weaknesses of each competitor as perceived by the
stakeholder or end user.]

## Product features

[List and briefly describe the product features. Features are the high-level capabilities of the system that are
necessary to deliver benefits to the users. Each feature is an externally desired service that typically requires a
series of inputs to achieve the desired result. For example, a feature of a problem tracking system might be the
ability to provide trending reports. As the use-case model takes shape, update the description to refer to the use
cases.
Because the Vision document is reviewed by a wide variety of involved personnel, the level of detail needs to be
general enough for everyone to understand. However, enough detail must be available to provide the team with the
information they need to create a use-case model.
Throughout this section, each feature will be externally perceivable by users, operators, or other external systems.
These features should include a description of functionality and any relevant usability issues that must be addressed.
]
[Can use a table to list product features, which each row provides feature, description, priority as follows

| No. | Feature | Description | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Non-functional requirements

[Provide non-functional requirements that globally affect the product features descrived in the previous section.
At a high level, list applicable standards, hardware, or platform requirements; performance requirements; and
environmental requirements.
Define the quality ranges for performance, robustness, fault tolerance, usability,etc.
